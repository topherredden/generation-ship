## J-Drive Changes
- J-Drive is called a 'Fold Drive'.
- F-Drives now take up twice the tonnage of J-Drives.
- F-Drives have no fuel cost to activate but instead have a fold capacitor to handle the immense exotic energy needed to open a fold space vortex.
- F-Drive speed is based on Jump rating. Jump-4 means you can travel 4 parsecs in 1 day. This also means you can travel 2 parsecs in 12 hours.
- F-Drives can only operate for a certain duration before they must exit fold space in order to bleed off accumulated fold energies.
- While charging or operating F-Drives the reactor consumes at 4x the normal rate.
